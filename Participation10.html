        I wanted to create a font that would be fun and bubbly. I think it was very helpful that the metaflop site had a graph to the side for one to use to see how the customized font is coming out. The first thing that I wanted to make sure from my font, is that it will be readable by the user. I made the strokes of the characters to be thicker. It was exciting to see that there was an option to change the height of the bar, which I always have fun moving, since it definitely helps with giving the letter a personality.
